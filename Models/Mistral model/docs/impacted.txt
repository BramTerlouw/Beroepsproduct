1. Objective

This document outlines the policy and procedures for the treatment of patients with an impacted fracture at Fictitious Hospital. It provides guidelines based on three priority factors: location of the fracture, severity of the fracture, and the patient’s age/health status.
2. Definitions

    Impacted Fracture: A type of fracture where the ends of the broken bone are driven into each other, often resulting from compressive forces or trauma.
    Priority Factors: Three clinical factors guiding treatment decisions: location, severity, and patient characteristics.

3. Priority Factors and Treatment Protocol
3.1 Location of the Fracture

    High-Risk Locations: Femur, tibia, humerus.
        Action: Immediate orthopedics consultation and X-ray examination. Consider MRI or CT scan for detailed assessment. Immediate reduction and stabilization, often requiring surgical intervention and possible internal fixation.
    Moderate-Risk Locations: Radius, ulna, fibula.
        Action: X-ray to confirm the fracture. Reduction and immobilization with a cast or splint. Orthopedics consultation within 24 hours for evaluation and potential further intervention.
    Low-Risk Locations: Metacarpals, phalanges.
        Action: X-ray to confirm the fracture. Immobilization with a splint or tape. Follow-up within a week at the outpatient clinic.

3.2 Severity of the Fracture

    Severe Impacted Fractures: Significant bone impaction with possible involvement of joints or extensive soft tissue damage.
        Action: Immediate reduction and stabilization, often requiring surgical intervention. Pain management with opioids and NSAIDs. Multidisciplinary team consultation may be needed for complex cases.
    Moderate Impacted Fractures: Moderate impaction with some displacement but no major joint involvement.
        Action: Reduction and immobilization with cast or brace. Follow-up within 48 hours to monitor alignment and healing. Consider additional imaging if complications arise.
    Minor Impacted Fractures: Minimal impaction with limited displacement.
        Action: Reduction and immobilization with a splint or tape. Pain relief with acetaminophen or NSAIDs. Follow-up in 7 days to assess healing and alignment.

3.3 Age and Health Status of the Patient

    Children and Adolescents (up to 18 years):
        Action: Monitor for potential impact on growth and bone development. Consult with pediatric orthopedics if needed. Conservative treatment with cast or splint and regular follow-up.
    Adults (18-65 years):
        Action: Treatment based on location and severity of the fracture. May require surgical intervention and rehabilitation. Follow-up to ensure proper healing and functional recovery.
    Elderly (>65 years) or Patients with Comorbidities:
        Action: Cautious approach due to increased risk of complications and slower healing. Consult with geriatrics if needed. Intensive follow-up and potential adjustments in treatment based on recovery progress.

4. General Policy

    Imaging: All impacted fractures must be confirmed with X-ray examination. MRI or CT scan may be necessary for detailed assessment of complex cases.
    Pain Management: Provide pain relief based on the severity of the fracture and the patient’s pain experience. Opioids may be used for severe pain, along with NSAIDs for moderate pain.
    Follow-up: Patients should have a follow-up appointment within 7 days of initial treatment to evaluate healing and alignment. Additional follow-ups may be required based on the complexity of the fracture and recovery progress.

5. Documentation

All treatment steps, including imaging, reduction procedures, consultations, and pain management, must be meticulously documented in the electronic patient record (EPR). Ensure that all data is complete and timely to support ongoing care and follow-up.
