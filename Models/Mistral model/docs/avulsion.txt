1. Objective

This document outlines the policy and procedures for the treatment of patients with an avulsion fracture at Fictitious Hospital. It provides guidelines based on three priority factors: location of the fracture, severity of the fracture, and the patient’s age/health status.
2. Definitions

    Avulsion Fracture: A type of fracture where a fragment of bone is pulled off by a tendon or ligament due to sudden force or trauma.
    Priority Factors: Three clinical factors guiding treatment decisions: location, severity, and patient characteristics.

3. Priority Factors and Treatment Protocol
3.1 Location of the Fracture

    High-Risk Locations: Hip, pelvis, proximal femur.
        Action: Immediate orthopedics consultation and X-ray examination. Consider MRI or CT scan for detailed assessment if needed. Immediate reduction and stabilization, often requiring surgical intervention to address potential complications and ensure proper alignment.
    Moderate-Risk Locations: Ankle, knee, shoulder.
        Action: X-ray to confirm the fracture. Reduction and immobilization with a cast or brace. Orthopedics consultation within 24 hours for further evaluation and possible additional treatment.
    Low-Risk Locations: Fingers, toes.
        Action: X-ray to confirm the fracture. Immobilization with a splint or tape. Follow-up within a week at the outpatient clinic to monitor healing and alignment.

3.2 Severity of the Fracture

    Severe Avulsion Fractures: Large bone fragment avulsion with significant displacement or involvement of adjacent soft tissues or joints.
        Action: Immediate reduction and stabilization, often requiring surgical intervention and possible internal fixation. Pain management with opioids and NSAIDs. Multidisciplinary consultation may be needed for complex cases.
    Moderate Avulsion Fractures: Noticeable avulsion with some displacement but without severe involvement of joints or soft tissues.
        Action: Reduction and immobilization with cast or brace. Follow-up within 48 hours to monitor alignment and healing. Additional imaging may be required if complications arise.
    Minor Avulsion Fractures: Small avulsion with minimal displacement.
        Action: Immobilization with a splint or tape, pain relief with acetaminophen or NSAIDs. Follow-up in 7 days to assess healing and alignment.

3.3 Age and Health Status of the Patient

    Children and Adolescents (up to 18 years):
        Action: Monitor for potential impact on growth and bone development. Consult with pediatric orthopedics if needed. Conservative treatment with cast or splint and regular follow-up to ensure proper healing and growth.
    Adults (18-65 years):
        Action: Treatment based on fracture location and severity. May include casting, splinting, and possible surgical intervention. Follow-up to ensure proper alignment, healing, and functional recovery.
    Elderly (>65 years) or Patients with Comorbidities:
        Action: Cautious approach due to increased risk of complications and slower healing. Consult with geriatrics if needed. Intensive follow-up and comprehensive management to address fracture healing and potential underlying health issues.

4. General Policy

    Imaging: All avulsion fractures must be confirmed with X-ray examination. MRI or CT scan may be necessary for detailed assessment of complex cases or to evaluate soft tissue involvement.
    Pain Management: Provide pain relief based on the severity of the fracture and the patient’s pain experience. Opioids may be used for severe pain, along with NSAIDs for moderate pain.
    Follow-up: Patients should have a follow-up appointment within 7 days of initial treatment to evaluate healing and alignment. Additional follow-ups may be required based on the complexity of the fracture and recovery progress.

5. Documentation

All treatment steps, including imaging, reduction procedures, consultations, and pain management, must be thoroughly documented in the electronic patient record (EPR). Ensure all data is complete and timely to support ongoing care and follow-up.
